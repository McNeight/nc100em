Notes on GTK+
-------------

You need GTK+ to compile gnc100em. I'm not entirely sure how old a
version of GTK+ gnc100em will work with - what I *can* say is that I
know it works with >=1.2.2, and I suspect it might not work with
1.0.x.

Note that, if your copy of GTK+ is from a Linux distribution rather
than from the net, it'll most likely be split up into two packages -
one with enough to run precompiled programs (shared libs), and a
`devel' one with header files, `gtk-config', etc. (For example, in
Debian 2.2 these are called `libgtk1.2' and `libgtk1.2-dev'
respectively.) As may be obvious, you need *both* installed before you
can compile a GTK+ program.

If you don't know which version of GTK+ you have installed, or if you
don't know whether you have it installed or not, try `gtk-config
--version'. (If that fails, you don't have GTK+ installed; or at
least, you certainly don't have enough installed to compile stuff.)

If you haven't got GTK+, or you seem to need a newer version, try
looking on http://www.gtk.org/.
