zcntools currently completely ignores nc200.card. Should have `-2'
option for all those too, *eventually*, to make them use that. I say
eventually, as this isn't terribly urgent - ZCN itself is well broken
on the NC200 atm. :-)


romdump doesn't support the NC200 yet - it should.


Probably the most important other pending thing (Lapcat support) is in
the README, under `Future developments'.


The X versions should probably unpress all keys when they lose
keyboard focus. This is a bigger problem than it first appears - using
alt-tab to switch away then back results in the keyboard mysteriously
`hanging' - because alt (= symbol) is pressed. :-)


There's a strange bug to do with serial input when running bbcbas,
which I haven't yet been able to figure out - see BUGS section in the
man page.

(I *think* this may be due to bbcbas keeping interrupts off so much
(IIRC). This probably means that, since it'll keep trying to interrupt
every instruction, serial_input_pending() gets called a LOT. Slightly
tricky to fix though.)
